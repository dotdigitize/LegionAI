## Overview

**Legion AI** is designed to dynamically spawn agents based on user input, allowing these agents to collaborate, critique, and refine ideas to provide sophisticated solutions to complex tasks. Using state-of-the-art methods such as PAST, RAFT, and EAT, it enables dynamic reasoning that evolves over time, enhancing the overall thought process.

---

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Spawning:** Dynamically generates multiple expert agents based on user input.
- **Collaborative Reasoning:** Agents work together to provide insights, critique solutions, and refine ideas.
- **Advanced Methods:** Utilizes methods like PAST, RAFT, and EAT for complex problem-solving.
- **Guided Conversations:** A guiding agent ensures that the conversation stays focused on the userâ€™s original question.

## Methodology

### PAST Method

The **PAST** (Personas, Actions, Solutions, and Task) method is the initial stage of reasoning where the system spawns the appropriate experts (personas) based on the user's query. Each agent is assigned a specific action to perform, contributing to an overall task.

### RAFT Method

The **RAFT** (Reasoning, Analysis, Feedback, and Thought) method comes into play in the second phase of reasoning, where agents exchange feedback and critique one another's thoughts. This enables deeper reasoning and leads to more refined solutions.

### EAT Method

**EAT** (Evaluation, Action, and Testing) is the final iterative phase. Agents test the viability of their suggestions by critically evaluating the effectiveness of their proposals and providing actionable recommendations to the user.

## Example Usage

Here is a basic example of how to interact with the Legion AI system:

```python
# Import the necessary modules
from legion_ai import ChatManager

# Start a chat session
chat_manager = ChatManager()
chat_manager.start_chat()
```

During the interaction, you can ask complex questions like:

```
How can I optimize my deep learning model for energy efficiency?
```

The system will then spawn agents like Geoffrey Hinton, Claude Shannon, and Ada Lovelace to collaborate on the solution.

## Applications

Legion AI can be applied in various fields:
- **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):** Simulating the reasoning processes behind AGI.
- **Collaborative Problem Solving:** Useful for brainstorming sessions, research, and decision-making.
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning:** Optimize models and processes with expert knowledge.
- **Business and Strategy:** Spawn experts in economics, strategy, and innovation to refine business decisions.
