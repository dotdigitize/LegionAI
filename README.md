## Overview

**Legion AI** represents a significant shift in how we approach Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It is not just a multi-agent system—it is a collaborative platform where autonomous agents work together to tackle complex, real-world problems that require multi-faceted reasoning and iterative refinement. The goal of this project is to build a foundation where machine cognition can progress toward independent, self-directed thought. 

In the current AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) landscape, large-scale language models have transformed how we interact with and utilize AI. Open-source local language models are at the forefront of this transformation. These models offer a more accessible alternative to proprietary systems, and they can be customized and integrated into complex systems such as **Legion AI**, where multiple agents are required to collaborate on solving advanced problems.

The purpose of **Legion AI** is to address the limitations of current reasoning models by creating an environment of **collaborative reasoning**. Here, agents are dynamically spawned and work together to provide deeper, more refined solutions to complex queries. Unlike traditional AI models that work in isolation, the agents in Legion AI represent a variety of knowledge domains and engage in back-and-forth reasoning, critiquing, and refining each other's ideas until a comprehensive solution is reached.

### The Role of Open-Source Models in AGI Development

Open-source models like **LLaMA 3.1: 8B** and **Gemma2: 2B** have proven to be extremely versatile for a range of tasks such as text generation, commonsense reasoning, and even symbolic reasoning. These models are optimized for performance across a range of tasks, and their open-source nature allows the broader community to contribute to improvements and innovations.

By integrating open-source models like **LLaMA** and **Gemma**, **Legion AI** ensures that the project remains accessible and collaborative. This choice also aligns with the project's mission of advancing AGI through community-driven research, rather than relying on closed, commercial models.

### Why Collaboration Matters

The challenges faced by today’s NLP systems include tasks that require not only large datasets but also reasoning and commonsense knowledge that go beyond memorization. Consider tasks such as commonsense reasoning, arithmetic, symbolic manipulation, and abstract problem-solving. These are domains where scaling alone is not sufficient to unlock a model's full potential. It requires more nuanced reasoning that can only be achieved through multi-agent collaboration.

**Legion AI** aims to:

1. **Decompose complex problems** into manageable tasks, enabling agents to collaborate on each step of the solution.
2. **Provide a more interpretable window** into AI reasoning, allowing users to debug and refine the reasoning process as they observe the interactions between agents.
3. **Extend beyond typical tasks**, making it applicable to any domain where collective human expertise can be replicated through agent spawning.

### Moving Beyond Current Approaches

While open-source models like **LLaMA** and **Gemma** demonstrate the promise of few-shot learning, their ability to perform high-level reasoning is significantly enhanced in **Legion AI**. By creating an environment where agents not only collaborate but also learn from each other, the system refines ideas through back-and-forth reasoning. **Legion AI** goes beyond mere language model prompting by enabling deeper, multi-agent interaction.

Imagine a future where agents in **Legion AI** represent experts in different fields, collaborating to solve business challenges, optimize machine learning models, or create new scientific theories. These agents are not just executing pre-programmed instructions—they are reasoning, critiquing, and iterating to reach a collective decision.

### Applications of Legion AI

The applications of **Legion AI** are broad and span multiple industries. Here are some of the potential areas where this technology can be applied:

- **Research and Development**: Scientists can use Legion AI to simulate expert collaborations across different domains, such as physics, biology, or engineering.
- **Business Optimization**: Companies can leverage Legion AI to simulate teams of experts that work together on improving business models, optimizing supply chains, or solving complex logistical problems.
- **Educational Tools**: Students and educators can use Legion AI to access a range of experts in different fields, enabling richer learning experiences and deeper insights into complex topics.

**Legion AI** is designed with the future in mind. Its framework enables continuous evolution, where agents can be retrained and improved with each iteration, ensuring that the system remains at the cutting edge of AGI research.

### The Collaborative Future

**Legion AI** represents a significant leap toward AGI by combining the power of open-source large language models and a multi-agent collaborative framework. By encouraging a community-driven approach, Legion AI is not just advancing AI—it's laying the groundwork for future breakthroughs in machine cognition, AGI, and eventually ASI.

This open-source project is designed to evolve, and contributions from researchers, engineers, and AI enthusiasts are not only welcomed but are a critical part of the project’s future success.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Spawning:** Dynamically generates multiple expert agents based on user input.
- **Collaborative Reasoning:** Agents work together to provide insights, critique solutions, and refine ideas.
- **Advanced Methods:** Utilizes methods like PAST, RAFT, and EAT for complex problem-solving.
- **Guided Conversations:** A guiding agent ensures that the conversation stays focused on the user’s original question.

## Methodology

### PAST Method

The **PAST** (Personas, Actions, Solutions, and Task) method is the initial stage of reasoning where the system spawns the appropriate experts (personas) based on the user's query. Each agent is assigned a specific action to perform, contributing to an overall task. This method ensures that all agents work towards the problem’s solution from different angles, making the conversation both creative and focused.

### RAFT Method

The **RAFT** (Reasoning, Analysis, Feedback, and Thought) method comes into play in the second phase of reasoning, where agents exchange feedback and critique one another's thoughts. This enables deeper reasoning and leads to more refined solutions. RAFT ensures that no solution is finalized without careful scrutiny and further elaboration.

### EAT Method

**EAT** (Evaluation, Action, and Testing) is the final iterative phase. Agents test the viability of their suggestions by critically evaluating the effectiveness of their proposals and providing actionable recommendations to the user. This method is designed to bring the conversation back to a practical level, providing real-world solutions that can be implemented.

## Applications

Legion AI can be applied in various fields:
- **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):** Simulating the reasoning processes behind AGI, using agents to learn, iterate, and make decisions collaboratively.
