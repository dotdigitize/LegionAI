## Overview

**Legion AI** spawning represents a significant shift in how we approach Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It is not just a multi-agent system—it is a collaborative platform where autonomous agents work together to tackle complex, real-world problems that require multi-faceted reasoning and iterative refinement. The goal of this project is to build a foundation where machine cognition can progress toward independent, self-directed thought. 

In the current AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) landscape, large-scale language models have transformed how we interact with and utilize AI. Open-source local language models are at the forefront of this transformation. These models offer a more accessible alternative to proprietary systems, and they can be customized and integrated into complex systems such as **Legion AI**, where multiple agents are required to collaborate on solving advanced problems.

The purpose of **Legion AI** is to address the limitations of current reasoning models by creating an environment of **collaborative reasoning**. Here, agents are dynamically spawned and work together to provide deeper, more refined solutions to complex queries. Unlike traditional AI models that work in isolation, the agents in Legion AI represent a variety of knowledge domains and engage in back-and-forth reasoning, critiquing, and refining each other's ideas until a comprehensive solution is reached.

### The Role of Open-Source Models in AGI Development

Open-source models like **LLaMA 3.1: 8B** and **Gemma2: 2B** that are used in the code sample provided here, have proven to me to be extremely versatile for a range of tasks such as text generation, commonsense reasoning, and even symbolic reasoning. These models are optimized with performance in mind across a range of tasks, and their open-source nature allows the broader community to contribute to improvements and innovations.

By integrating open-source models like **LLaMA** and **Gemma** for example, **Legion AI** ensures that the project remains accessible and collaborative. This choice also aligns with the project's mission of advancing towards AGI through community-driven research, rather than relying on closed, commercial models.

### Why Collaboration Matters

The challenges faced by today’s NLP systems include tasks that require not only large datasets but also reasoning and commonsense knowledge that go beyond memorization. Consider tasks such as commonsense reasoning, arithmetic, symbolic manipulation, and abstract problem-solving. These are domains where scaling alone is not sufficient to unlock a model's full potential. It requires more nuanced reasoning that can only be achieved through multi-agent collaboration.

**Legion AI** aims to:

1. **Decompose complex problems** into manageable tasks, enabling agents to collaborate on each step of the solution.
2. **Provide a more interpretable window** into AI reasoning, allowing users to debug and refine the reasoning process as they observe the interactions between agents.
3. **Extend beyond typical tasks**, making it applicable to any domain where collective human expertise can be replicated through agent spawning.

### Moving Beyond Current Approaches

While open-source local lanaguage models have demonstrate the promise of few-shot learning, their ability to perform high-level reasoning is significantly enhanced in **Legion AI**. By creating an environment where agents not only collaborate but also learn from each other, the system refines ideas through back-and-forth reasoning through different reasoning methods.  Imagine a future where agents in **Legion AI** represent experts in different fields, collaborating to solve business challenges, optimize machine learning models, or create new scientific theories. These agents are not just executing pre-programmed instructions—they are reasoning, critiquing, and iterating to reach a collective decision.

### Applications of Legion AI

The applications of **Legion AI** are broad and span multiple industries. Here are some of the potential areas where this technology can be applied:

- **Research and Development**: Scientists can use Legion AI to simulate expert collaborations across different domains, such as physics, biology, or engineering.
- **Business Optimization**: Companies can leverage Legion AI to simulate teams of experts that work together on improving business models, optimizing supply chains, or solving complex logistical problems.
- **Educational Tools**: Students and educators can use Legion AI to access a range of experts in different fields, enabling richer learning experiences and deeper insights into complex topics.

**Legion AI** is designed with the future in mind. Its framework enables continuous evolution, where agents can be retrained and improved with each iteration, ensuring that the system remains at the cutting edge of AGI research.

## Methodology

### PAST Method

The **PAST** (Personas, Actions, Solutions, and Task) method is the initial stage of reasoning where the system spawns the appropriate experts (personas) based on the user's query. Each agent is assigned a specific action to perform, contributing to an overall task. This method ensures that all agents work towards the problem’s solution from different angles, making the conversation both creative and focused.

### RAFT Method

The **RAFT** (Reasoning, Analysis, Feedback, and Thought) method comes into play in the second phase of reasoning, where agents exchange feedback and critique one another's thoughts. This enables deeper reasoning and leads to more refined solutions. RAFT ensures that no solution is finalized without careful scrutiny and further elaboration.

### EAT Method

**EAT** (Evaluation, Action, and Testing) is the final iterative phase. Agents test the viability of their suggestions by critically evaluating the effectiveness of their proposals and providing actionable recommendations to the user. This method is designed to bring the conversation back to a practical level, providing real-world solutions that can be implemented.

## Future Scope

## 1. Agent Memory: Developing Short-term and Long-term Memory Systems

A crucial element in enabling AI to perform tasks autonomously and efficiently over time is its ability to remember past interactions and learn from them. Legion AI's architecture envisions a two-tiered memory system: **short-term memory** (STM) and **long-term memory** (LTM). 

**Short-term memory (STM)** will allow Legion AI agents to temporarily retain relevant data, aiding them in executing multi-step tasks or solving problems that require immediate attention. STM is particularly useful for tasks such as math problem-solving or quick decision-making, where intermediate steps are critical for arriving at the final output. This memory system can act as a working memory space for agents and is vital in allowing for complex, ongoing tasks where context is crucial.

On the other hand, **long-term memory (LTM)** will enable the agents to develop an evolving understanding of users and the problems they face over time. By retaining insights from previous conversations and learning from past interactions, agents will become more adept at offering personalized, context-aware responses. The long-term memory will form the backbone of **Chain of Memory** architecture, which not only stores memories but recalls them at the right time to influence future interactions.

This system is inspired by human cognitive processes where memories go through encoding, consolidation, and retrieval phases. Just as humans rely on memories to build on past experiences, Legion AI agents will be designed to store and organize information based on significance, recency, and usage frequency. For example, more critical or frequently referenced memories will be more readily accessible, while less-used memories may fade into the background, a principle similar to **memory reconsolidation** in humans.

**Chain of Memory** will function by generating natural language outputs that include intermediate reasoning steps, referred to as **Chain-of-Intermediates**. This system will enable Legion AI to break down complex tasks into manageable subtasks, process them, and store relevant details for future recall. This memory retrieval mechanism will allow agents to maintain continuity in conversations, improve over time, and develop a more refined understanding of both the users and the context of interactions.

In terms of real-world application, STM can be utilized in cases where quick processing and contextually aware decision-making are essential, such as customer service or dynamic problem-solving environments. LTM will be vital for applications requiring deeper personalization, such as healthcare, education, or personal assistants that evolve with the user.

## 2. Cross-Domain Knowledge Integration

A significant goal of Legion AI is to extend its knowledge beyond traditional domains, incorporating more specialized fields like law, medicine, social sciences, and beyond. Achieving AGI involves creating a system that is not only knowledgeable in a variety of fields but can integrate and apply this knowledge seamlessly across different domains. By expanding its database and knowledge base to include specialized data from these sectors, Legion AI agents will be equipped to tackle more complex and cross-domain tasks.

For example, in legal assistance, agents could leverage medical knowledge to solve cases involving malpractice or personal injury, providing users with insights that span across domains. Similarly, in education, agents could integrate knowledge from psychology and education science to create more adaptive and personalized learning experiences.

The integration of cross-domain knowledge will be facilitated by employing **Chain-of-Augmentation** techniques. In this framework, agents will dynamically retrieve external knowledge, either from open-source databases or domain-specific repositories, during reasoning processes. These external augmentations will be seamlessly integrated into the agents’ reasoning chains, ensuring they are equipped with the most accurate and relevant data to solve domain-specific problems.

Moreover, Legion AI will use **Chain-of-Knowledge Composition**, which focuses on accumulating relevant knowledge step by step. For instance, if a user is working on a research project in medicine, Legion AI will gradually build up a body of knowledge through intermediate steps, consulting various medical databases or scientific repositories to arrive at a comprehensive response.

## 3. Real-Time Learning and Adaptive Agents

Legion AI’s agents are designed to continuously evolve through real-time learning mechanisms. This allows the system to improve its problem-solving capabilities based on interactions and feedback from users. Drawing inspiration from real-time machine learning models, this feature will enable agents to not only learn from their mistakes but also to adapt to new contexts and refine their decision-making processes.

The agents' learning systems will be based on **reinforcement learning** principles, where they are rewarded for accurate, efficient, or insightful answers. This feedback loop helps in continuously optimizing their performance. Moreover, agents will evolve through a system that mirrors **neural network integration**, where they mimic biological processes such as **synaptic plasticity** to strengthen connections between certain memory traces or learned behaviors.

A more advanced form of memory retention that is part of Legion AI's future scope involves **reconsolidation**, where agents can modify or update their long-term memory based on new information. Reconsolidation in human cognition refers to the process where previously consolidated memories become susceptible to change when reactivated. Legion AI's agents will employ similar mechanisms to update memories and learn from ongoing interactions, ensuring they remain relevant and up-to-date.

This approach will be central to the realization of **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**. By equipping the system with the ability to learn from real-time interactions, Legion AI can reduce the need for human intervention, thus advancing closer to AGI, where the system autonomously understands and solves problems across various domains.

## 4. Chain of Memory Retrieval System

Building on the concept of **Chain-of-Thought prompting**, Legion AI introduces the **Chain of Memory** system, where memories are stored and retrieved in a manner that mimics human cognitive functions. In Legion AI, different agents will have distinct memory types, allowing for specialized knowledge retention based on the nature of the task.

### 4.1 Chain-of-Intermediates
This system will utilize intermediate steps in reasoning to help agents break down complex problems into simpler, manageable tasks. The primary focus here is problem decomposition, where large problems are segmented into smaller parts that can be individually tackled, stored in memory, and then recalled for future use. This mirrors the process of **working memory**, where short-term information is used to perform complex cognitive operations.

Chain-of-Intermediates will also integrate knowledge from multiple sources, employing **Chain-of-Knowledge Composition** to provide depth and detail in the agents’ reasoning process. Agents will be able to retrieve this information when needed, creating a more robust and adaptable reasoning system. In domains such as medical diagnosis or legal reasoning, this system will enable agents to combine multiple sources of knowledge to arrive at informed decisions.

### 4.2 Memory Augmentation and Retrieval
Memory retrieval in Legion AI will not be a passive process; instead, it will actively involve **Chain-of-Augmentation**, where agents augment their reasoning by retrieving external knowledge dynamically. This system is particularly useful in cases where agents encounter unfamiliar or domain-specific tasks.

By incorporating memory augmentation, agents can call upon external databases or knowledge sources to fill in gaps in their understanding, making the system much more versatile. For instance, in technical fields like engineering or finance, agents can access up-to-date information from external APIs or knowledge bases to provide accurate, real-time responses.

Moreover, retrieval will be aided by **Chain-of-Histories**, which uses past experiences to inform current decisions. This aspect of memory retrieval is particularly relevant in user-facing applications, where understanding the user’s history and preferences is key to delivering personalized responses. In customer service, for example, agents could retrieve past conversations and interactions, ensuring continuity and a more coherent, user-centric experience.

## 5. Moving Towards AGI

The future scope of Legion AI involves scaling up the platform's capabilities, integrating neural networks that mimic biological processes like synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation. Through **real-time learning**, **cross-domain integration**, and the introduction of **Chain of Memory** systems, the platform is set to advance toward AGI, wherein agents can operate across a multitude of tasks and domains seamlessly.

## 6. Open resource AGI

As we advance toward AGI, ethical considerations take on greater significance. The prospect of AGI evolving into Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) brings forth both exciting opportunities. By maintaining Legion AI as an open resource for non-commercial and military applications, we strive to democratize AGI development, ensuring that its evolution is not controlled by a select few.

1. Open Resource: Legion AI will be available as freely accessible code, enabling developers and researchers to use, modify, and contribute to the project, while ensuring proper attribution to me, "Joey Perez."

2. Non-Commercial Use: The resource can be utilized by individuals, researchers, or organizations for educational, research, or personal projects, but not for profit, ensuring broader access without commercial exploitation.

3. Military Use: The technology may also be employed for military applications, enabling defense organizations to utilize it for research or strategic purposes under regulated guidelines.

This approach aims to promote ethical development and equitable access to the technology while allowing for beneficial uses in national security and public interest.

The primary objective of Legion AI is to achieve AGI or, at the very least, to aid in the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), a system capable of understanding and addressing problems across diverse domains without human input. The potential for AGI to evolve into Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) brings significant opportunities—and challenges—for society. By fostering an open and collaborative project, we seek to keep AGI development within the global community’s control, preventing it from being dominated by a small number of powerful entities.
