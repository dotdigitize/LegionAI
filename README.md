# Legion AI

Legion AI is a multi-agent, reasoning-based artificial intelligence framework that dynamically spawns agents based on user input to collaboratively brainstorm, refine, and evaluate solutions to complex problems. This system leverages advanced reasoning techniques like the **PAST** method, RAFT, EAT, and other iterative thinking processes to improve the quality of agent-based collaboration.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Agent Spawning**: Agents are created based on the user’s input, selecting real-life or hypothetical personas to address specific tasks.
- **Advanced Reasoning Techniques**: Agents collaborate using methods such as **PAST**, RAFT, and EAT, iterating over multiple cycles of thought to arrive at deeper conclusions.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Legion AI keeps track of ongoing conversations and refines its responses, ensuring that the agents evolve their thinking as more input is provided.
- **Topic Guidance**: The system ensures that agents stay on track, guided by a specialized **Guiding Agent** to ensure the conversation remains focused on the original question.

## Overview

Legion AI is designed to simulate complex problem-solving dynamics by introducing agents who collaborate in real-time. It is ideal for brainstorming, task planning, and research projects where multiple perspectives are needed to explore all facets of an issue. 

Legion AI uses advanced models, including LLaMa and Ollama, to communicate and reason through user queries, iterating over multiple levels of thought refinement.

## How Legion AI Works

### PAST Method

The **PAST** method is a structured approach to problem-solving that stands for **Personas, Actions, Situations, Tasks**:

- **Personas**: Agents with specific expertise or roles are spawned based on the user’s query.
- **Actions**: These agents generate actions or propose solutions according to their persona.
- **Situations**: Agents analyze the user’s query and the broader context to identify core problems.
- **Tasks**: Agents perform tasks to deliver actionable solutions and recommendations.

Example:

User Input: "How do I optimize a deep learning model?"

- **Situation**: The system identifies the query as a machine learning issue.
- **Personas**: Agents such as Geoffrey Hinton (neural networks expert) and Claude Shannon (information theory expert) are spawned.
- **Actions**: Hinton proposes backpropagation optimization, while Shannon analyzes information flow.
- **Tasks**: The agents collaborate to refine and synthesize their recommendations.

### Advanced Reasoning Modes (RAFT & EAT)

As the conversation deepens, Legion AI evolves from the initial PAST method to more sophisticated reasoning modes:

- **RAFT** (Recursive Agent Feedback Technique): Agents exchange feedback, refining one another’s responses and iterating on solutions.
- **EAT** (Evaluate, Act, Test): Agents evaluate the results of previous conclusions and critique each solution for feasibility and completeness. This ensures the output is actionable and practical.
