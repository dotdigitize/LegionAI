![LegionAI1 dotdigitize creativedisruptor](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8576e96a-84ed-47ac-89f3-9bde269390b6)

## Overview

**Legion AI** is more than just a multi-agent system; it’s a step toward the future of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The project utilizes a dynamic agent-spawning system to tackle complex, real-world problems through collaboration, reasoning, and iterative improvement. By creating a system where agents representing distinct areas of expertise work together, Legion AI fosters an environment of collective intelligence—a crucial element in the race toward AGI and, eventually, Artificial Superintelligence (ASI).

The **purpose** of this code is to build a foundation where machine cognition becomes increasingly capable of self-directed, independent thought, capable of tackling multi-faceted problems that stretch beyond simple algorithmic logic. Legion AI is not just about what it can do today—it's about how it can evolve into a platform that fosters collaborative AI thinking on a global scale.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Spawning:** Dynamically generates multiple expert agents based on user input.
- **Collaborative Reasoning:** Agents work together to provide insights, critique solutions, and refine ideas.
- **Advanced Methods:** Utilizes methods like PAST, RAFT, and EAT for complex problem-solving.
- **Guided Conversations:** A guiding agent ensures that the conversation stays focused on the user’s original question.

## Methodology

### PAST Method

The **PAST** (Personas, Actions, Solutions, and Task) method is the initial stage of reasoning where the system spawns the appropriate experts (personas) based on the user's query. Each agent is assigned a specific action to perform, contributing to an overall task. This method ensures that all agents work towards the problem’s solution from different angles, making the conversation both creative and focused.

### RAFT Method

The **RAFT** (Reasoning, Analysis, Feedback, and Thought) method comes into play in the second phase of reasoning, where agents exchange feedback and critique one another's thoughts. This enables deeper reasoning and leads to more refined solutions. RAFT ensures that no solution is finalized without careful scrutiny and further elaboration.

### EAT Method

**EAT** (Evaluation, Action, and Testing) is the final iterative phase. Agents test the viability of their suggestions by critically evaluating the effectiveness of their proposals and providing actionable recommendations to the user. This method is designed to bring the conversation back to a practical level, providing real-world solutions that can be implemented.

## Applications

Legion AI can be applied in various fields:
- **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):** Simulating the reasoning processes behind AGI, using agents to learn, iterate, and make decisions collaboratively.
- **Collaborative Problem Solving:** Useful for brainstorming sessions, research, and decision-making in any complex environment, including business strategy, academic research, and public policy.
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning:** Optimize machine learning models by allowing agents to analyze, critique, and refine solutions in real-time.
- **Business and Strategy:** Spawn experts in economics, innovation, and organizational behavior to refine strategic decisions for companies and organizations.

## Installation

To set up Legion AI, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dotdigitize/legion-ai.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd legion-ai
   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the system:
   ```bash
   python legion_ai.py
   ```

## Future Scope

Legion AI is a continuously evolving project. Future plans include:
- **Agent Memory:** Allowing agents to remember previous conversations and build on past insights to develop a long-term understanding of problems and users.
- **Cross-Domain Knowledge Integration:** Expanding the knowledge base to include more specialized fields such as law, medicine, and social sciences.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Implementing real-time learning for agents, enabling them to evolve and improve based on their interactions and feedback from users.

The ultimate goal of Legion AI is to contribute towards the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), a system that can understand and solve problems across various domains without human intervention. The potential for AGI to evolve into Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) presents enormous possibilities—and challenges—for society. By keeping the project open and collaborative, we aim to ensure that the development of AGI remains in the hands of the global community, rather than being monopolized by a few powerful entities.

## Collaboration

We believe that the future of AGI should be a collaborative effort, and **Legion AI** is a community-driven project. Our goal is to foster an environment where developers, researchers, and enthusiasts can work together toward the collective goal of advancing machine intelligence.

### How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or fix.
3. Submit a pull request with a detailed description of your changes.
4. Discuss your contributions with the community to improve and evolve the system.

Whether you have ideas to enhance the reasoning mechanisms, agent behaviors, or if you want to introduce new methodologies for problem-solving, we welcome your involvement.

**Join us in shaping the future of AGI.**
